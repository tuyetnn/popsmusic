For this project I(Ellie) worked with Tuyet. We both go to Madison Acedemic Highschool.  For the first page, Tuyet did the header. She also erased the background in the pops music logo to make it more visually appealing. It took awhile to get everything looking good on it. At one point there was a search bar, but not anymore. We both worked on the carousel. I set up the basic structure, which took a while to figure out for some reason. She added the images. Neither of us could find images for the carousel that looked decent. The ones on there are mostly ones I got from Pop's Musics's instagram page. I did everything below the carousel. Tuyet added the dividers however. Another thing Tuyet did on the home page is the shopping cart.

Tuyet did the Lessons Page. She had alot of trouble getting the rows to do what theyre supposed to do, however she eventually figured it out after I went to theCO help nights. 

I did the Sales Page which took a WHILE. Much more time than I thought it would take. Had problems getting the "view" buttons to line up and getting everything linked in working order. I got the card idea from my classmate Anmar. I was also going to use the same view item page he used but i decided to make my own which i like much better than the other one. 

Tuyet did the Rentals page which was also pretty difficult. Took awhile to get it figured out

I did the Repairs page. Initially i was going to add a table with pricing but decided to put reviews on there instead because that was simpler and i didnt have much time left.

When you click on the cart ( or the order page if youre on the view item on the store page) it takes you to a form. Tuyet did that. When you click the continue to check out page it takes you to a Thank You page. I added that because i felt like without it the link would seem like a dead end. 

I thought this project was alot of fun because i could listen to music while i did that and i though that was really cool because i love listening to music. I listened to mostly David Bowie and Queen. It made me more interested in getting an office job where i could do that. I looked into studying to be a programmer but im not sure about that. I enjoy coding though.
