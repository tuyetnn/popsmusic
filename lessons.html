    </div>
    <div class="col-8"> Cher D. Bond is an inspirational Artist from
      Mercer, Tennessee. Cher is a self-taught musician, songwriter,
      composer, and producer. Cher’s musical skills consist of the bass
      guitar, lead guitar, drums, and keyboard. Cher developed an
      interest in becoming a guitarist at the age of five. Cher improved
      her musical skills by practicing for hours. For example, Cher would
      practice before she went to bed, while waiting on the school bus,
      and after coming home from school. Eventually, she had the ability
      to play most of the songs sang at home and at church.The founder
      of the church Cher attended wanted to add other instruments to the
      music department. This, in turn, became a great opportunity for her
      and others to become exposed to various instruments such as the bass
      guitar, keyboard, and drums. Cher was determined to learn how to
      play each instrument. At the age of fourteen, Cher began playing
      guitar for the Bond Family. This brought about a lot of exposure
      to her musical talent. The church choir director took notice of
      Cher’s talent and appointed her as the musician for the youth choir.
      From there, Cher was selected to be the lead guitar player for the
      Senior Adult Choir and in time was placed over the Music Department.
      Cher continues to hold that position at her church today. Cher Bond
      now records and produces albums. Some of Cher’s accomplishments
      are as follows; in 2002, she produced her first gospel album entitled,
      “Look What You’ve Done for Me.” In 2003, she produced a
      2nd album for her church entitled, “It’s All About Jesus.”
      Again, in 2008, Cher produced a third album, entitled, “I Remember.”
      Last, but not least, in 2010, Cher produced and released a fourth album entitled,
      “I’m Going to Heaven.” In December, 2014 Cher produced a single entitled
      “God is Good” and in February 2015 she produced another single entitled
      “Our Love is Special.”
